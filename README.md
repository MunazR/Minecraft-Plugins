# Minecraft-Plugins
Bukkit plugins used on Minecraft serverst to perform various tasks and enhance player experience

These are a bunch of Mincraft plugins I developed. They have various functions and tasks. They were originally created for use on ipocketisland.com now known as minejam.com

The plugins are all developed in Java using CraftBukkit API. Some of them also integrate external APIs such as DisguiseCraft, CombatTag and Essentials. Additionally some of the plugins also use SQL for user data storage.
